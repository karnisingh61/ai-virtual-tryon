# AI Virtual Try-On System 👕🤖

The AI Virtual Try-On System is a full-stack web-based application that demonstrates how Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision techniques can be used to simulate an online clothing try-on experience.

Users can upload a person image and a clothing image, and the system generates a visual output showing how the selected clothing would appear on the person.

This project is developed for academic learning purposes.
